This is the first step in the research project held by Software Engineering department of Higher School of Economics, which concerns building up a component model with declarative description of compound data types. Here, VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is used to define the interaction of the components.

The project consists of two parts:
1) A bunch of JavaBeans components, representing the basic VRML objects and node/data types;
2) VRML parser, which produces a scene graph as a result of its work and initializes corresponding JavaBeans components.
